Inverse-design magnonic devices based off the paper [written by Wang Q. et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22897-4)

Some notes:
- I basically stopped using `video_converter.py` and `spin_wave_amplitude.py` (this one might be used again for the future) so I stopped updating its functionality
- Stuff left:
  - Building the DBS algorithm to actually make sure the multiplexer is functioning
  - Adding more damping zones towards the end? got lazy tho
  - Remove `DIMENSION` from the python files since im only using one layer thats 100nm thick now
